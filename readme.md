# moon-player-detector

## How it detects players

* Get all players which are further than `min` and closer than `max` blocks away from the player
  * *The `min` range is required to avoid counting players that are too close*

* From these players, find the closest player.

* From the closest player, count all players that are nearby

* These players are now detected
